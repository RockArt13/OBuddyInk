# OBuddyInk
The Story of Buddy. The testing project for the O Buddy, Where Art Thou? Game Project

# #AboutTheProject
This project was made during one-two weel.

The project's primary focus is to create an own story using INK plugin on Unity.

The important keys are

## 1. Download and start using the Ink tool. 

## 2. Get familiar with the basics and create a short story using it.

## 3. Add some logic in Ink story which controls the flow of the dialogue depending on some variables.

# #AboutAssets

All assets (graphics, sound, and music) are downloaded free from the websites providing free assets. Sounds and Musics are original.




# #RunTheGame
A build still needs to be created. 
Feel free to run the project Unity.
